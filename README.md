To use this calculator on Windows (tested on windows 11) download the Windows executable and left click it twice or do the same thing with the installer file and follow the instructions. Then look for "Rust Calculator" in the windows start menu.

To use the Linux version (tested on kubuntu) download the Linux executable and right click on the file. you then want to select run in Konsole (on different distributions of Linux this might say console or terminal). For newer versions (8.0.0 and up) just left click it twice  for the exactable or do the same thing for the debian package and follow the installation instructions look for the program in the start menu and launch it by clicking it.
