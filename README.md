A simple calculator I made in Rust.


[Link to use my calculator.](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=3de045da59768cadb6697a88bfc97311)

All you need to do is click the run button in the top left corner and than follow the instructions in the terminal.

Another way you can use this calculator is by downloading the files and running the version you want in you terminal.
